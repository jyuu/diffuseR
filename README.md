st790 advanced computing final project 

# some notes
- using data encrypted market data.. since high quality stock market data is guarded by data monopolies and hedge funds...  incentives are such that high quality datasets will become more secret and more expensive over time... the stock market, there is no free, high quality, public dataset for machine learning. 
- build on developments in cryptography, allowing us to share data sets, without destroying their utility to data science 
- structure-preserving encryption... allow machine learning algorithms to learn things 
- not easy to be right in the right way
- in stock market - financial incentive for secrecy is strong, but using these methods.. 

# ideas from multi-party computation
- could we take ideas from modern cryptography? 
- Homomorphic Encryption is replaceable by MPC
- MPC, advantage-uses cheap computation but a lot of interaction 
- MPC replaces expensive computation with interaction between 2 or more parties
